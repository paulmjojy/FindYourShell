# FindYourShell
The goal of this project is to create a website where users can submit reviews for on campus housing. This will be a challenge, as there are many different parts that will have to work together in order to make a fully functioning site.

# Database
There will have to be some sort of database to hold user information as a key and the reviews as the value. I believe a SQL Database would work to achieve this. We would then query the database using Python to pull the information, and Javascript to display on the webpage.

# Map
Google Maps has an API which I think would be useful for this. Not too sure on how it would be used though, will have to do some more research.

# Page
The webpage will be made in HTML/CSS. I think the optimal layout would be the homepage be the map, then when a place on the map is clicked, move to a new page with the information about that place.
